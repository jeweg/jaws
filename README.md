# jaws

Personal general classlib and Vulkan experiments.

Herein I explore design and implementation of things I like making or learning. Yes, that fuzzy and unspecific.
This is where I allow myself to go on any tangents I feel like at the day.
It might eventually grow into something more defined or even useful, but no pressure.
